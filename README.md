### Hello there, welcome :)

My name is Ana Vitória. I'm 22 years old and I work as a QA. However, I am in a career transition, I intend to migrate to the UX/UI design area.

Passionate about technology and people. Currently studying information systems at PUC Minas. I thrive in environments that value autonomy, creativity and empathy!

During my journey, I have had the opportunity to participate in challenging and enriching projects, which have provided me with solid practical and theoretical learning in the area of ​​Information Technology. Furthermore, I am always looking for new knowledge and skills, trying to stay updated in such a dynamic and competitive market.
